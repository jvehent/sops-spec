1.  Introduction

   The primary goal of the Sops document format is to provide a secure
   and practical way to store configuration files at rest.  Its intended
   audience is operational groups that engineer deployment systems for
   their infrastructure.

   The Sops 2 document format is designed to be used with structured
   file formats, such as JSON or YAML.  In those formats, Sops 2
   guarantees the confidentiality of configuration values stored in a
   given file, but does not protect the confidentiality of the document
   structure.  In other words: document keys are stored in cleartext and
   values are encrypted.  The reasons for this design choice are
   detailed in section X.Y.

   Sops 2 provides strong integrity guarantees to protect against
   malicious addition, removal and reordering of configuration values.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are used:

   o  document: a file that contains data requiring protection.

   o  document key: a symetric key that encrypts and decrypts the values
      of a document.

   o  master key: a symetric or asymetric key that encrypts and decrypts
      a document key a one of its fragment.

   o  key group: a set of master keys that encrypt or decrypt a document
      key or one of its fragment.

   o  threshold: a configurable number of key groups needed to recover a
      document key.

   o  mac: a message authentication code that protects the integrity of
      a document.
